This is a daily planner utilizing Javascript (with J-Query), Bootstrap, and the DayJS application.

Upon entering the site the user will be presented with a title and the current date.
Below is the actual planner which is split into 8 individual boxes, each representing one hour of the typical workday (9am-5pm).
The boxes will be colored based on the time of day, grey indicating that time slot has already passed, green indicating future time slots, and red indicating the current hour. 
The user can type into the text box and click the blue save button to the right of the box to save a reminder. 
This reminder is saved to local storage and, upon refreshing the page, will be printed to the same time slot it was saved on.
